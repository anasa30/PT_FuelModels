# FUMOD: Updated FUel MODels gridded dataset

This repository contains the fuel maps of fuel models for Portugal and the raw datasets used to develop them. 

**Package:** FUMOD

**Version:** V1

**Data:** December 2022

**Product:** Fuel Models Map

**Study area:** Mainland Portugal

**Properties:** Geotiff gridded datasets with pixel size of 100-m; UTM-29 projection

## Description
This package is built using ModelBuilder/ArcGis toolbox, developed to produce an updated Fuel Models Map (FMM), based on the overlap of several intermediate fuel models maps (SM) for a reference year. The updated FMM is obtained by running SM from 1 to 10. The algorithms developed to produce SM8 and SM9 are either confidential or rely on provisory data, respectively. Each SM is dependent on different datasets, all organized in a geodatabase. The FUMOD toolbox contains the SM toolsets, inside each there are the developed codes to geoprocess the models. Next figure guides the sequence of steps and datasets needed to produce the updated FMM. 


## Method overview

The flowchart below represents the proposed model (FUMOD) composed by a sequence of the 10 sub-models (SM) and eight datasets (labeled from A to H) to produce the updated fuel models map (FMM).

The dataset contains the layers identified with letters in the figure, namely:
- DATASET_A: Land cover (cos2018)
- DATASET_B: Corine land cover (2018)
- DATASET_C: National fire atlas
- DATASET_D: Satellite vegetation indexes
- DATASET_E: Copernicus tree density cover (2018)
- DATASET_F: Fieldwork
- DATASET_G: Land cover and fuel management operations
- DATASET_H: Bioclimatic and lithological classification
- Final map of fuel models

## Download the database file
The database file can be easily downloaded as a a geodatabase from GitHub by using Download Directory or DownGit, or by simply accessing to:

## Community Feedback
If you have any sugestion on how to improve the map of fuel models in Portugal or if you encounter any issue when downloading or using the dataset, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/anasa30/PT_FuelModels/issues).

## Frequency of data updates
The map of fuel models is updated once per year, before the starting of a new fire season in Portugal (around late spring). After an update, all the hyperlinks redirecting to the data download are also updated and older versions moved to the corresponding folder in [Fuel Models](https://github.com/anasa30/PT_FuelModels/tree/main/Fuel%20Models). The base layers that are used to generate the map of fuel models (e.g. land cover, national fire atlas, etc.) are available at the [Models](https://github.com/anasa30/PT_FuelModels/tree/main/FUMOD/Models) folder.

If you wish to download past versions you can use the [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) or [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/) and paste de hyperlink to the folder you wish to download. For example, to download the models of 2021 from DownGit simply paste the path to the folder (https://github.com/anasa30/PT_FuelModels/tree/main/FUMOD/Models/SubModels_2021.gdb) in the mainpage of DownGit [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/)
